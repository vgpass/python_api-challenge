## Files

README file: Background information and description of files in repo.

**Instructions folder**: This folder contains the instructions and original files found on GitLab in the course repo.

**WeatherPy folder:** This folder contains the files below:

* *Images* folder contains images of the charts generated by my code.

* *output_data* folder contains the .csv output files generated by my code, and used to create my working data frames.

*WeatherPycomplete* is my completed WeatherPy challenge code.

*VacationPycomplete* is my completed VacationPy challenge code

## Results

This was one of the more challenging assignments for me to date. Part of the reason was that I wasn't aware that the homework files found on Canvas were much different from the class repo on Git Lab. I was using the class repo and it was missing some starter code that would have been very helpful. I ended up working out a lot of what I needed to do on my own, but I enlisted quite a bit of help from AskBCS and from my tutor that week.
